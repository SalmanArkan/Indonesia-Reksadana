# Indonesia Reksadana

This project was used as a boot camp data analyst RevoU. This code aims to make an application that can buy and sell mutual funds (Indonesian: reksadana). The mutual funds consist of stocks mutual funds (saham), bond mutual funds (pendapatan tetap), money market mutual funds (pasar uang), and mixed-investment mutual funds (campuran). 

## Executive Summary

In response to the marketing team's objective of creating thematic campaigns tailored to user preferences for the next month, this executive summary outlines the approach to be taken by the data analyst at our Indonesian investment startup. Our application facilitates the buying and selling of mutual funds, categorized into stocks (saham), bonds (pendapatan tetap), money market (pasar uang), and mixed-investment (campuran) funds. 
Leveraging insights from the User Dataset, detailing registered user information, and the Daily User Transaction Dataset, offering user-level mutual fund balances, the primary goal is to conduct a strategic segmentation analysis. This analysis aims to identify distinct user groups based on their profiles and transactional behaviors. Subsequently, personalized thematic campaigns will be recommended for each segment, considering individual investment preferences and risk tolerances associated with different mutual fund types. The overarching objective is to enhance user engagement, satisfaction, and informed decision-making through targeted and compelling campaigns.
